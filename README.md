# This project has moved

The new repo is [here](https://github.com/wingnut-tech/LEDController).

The project has been renamed from FT-Night-Radian-LED-Controller to simply LEDController. It's easier to type, and also represents the fact that the controller isn't exclusive to the FT Night Radian anymore.

We've also done a complete revamp of the whole project structure. The single giant .ino file has been split out into proper .cpp and .h files for better organization.

This existing repo will be left as-is and archived. While we could have just renamed the repo, the new project structure would break existing verions of the LEDControllerUpdater app.
